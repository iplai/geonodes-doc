# 快速入门

```{admonition} 先备条件

在使用 **`geonodes`** 前，你必须先了解：
- `Blender` 几何节点
- `Python` 语言
- 如何在 `blender` 中执行 `Python` 脚本
```

安装与你的 `Blender` 兼容的 **geonodes** 版本。

```{important}
您可以问自己实现特定节点的方法的名称是什么，以及节点套接字的名称是什么。只需使用名称的snake_case版本。有关详细信息，请参阅命名约定。您也可以参考API文档。
```

## Importing the module

We suppose that all scripts start with the following import instruction:

``` python
import geonodes as gn
``` 

## My first tree

Execute the following piece of code:

``` python
import geonodes as gn

with gn.Tree("Do nothing tree") as tree:

   # og and ig are shortcuts for output_geometry and input_geometry

   tree.og = tree.ig
```

This code simply creates the tree which connects the input geometry to the output geometry.

Add a **Geometry Node** modifier to your Object and, as a parameter, select the node tree named "Do nothing tree" in the list.

And nothing happens as expected !

## My first operation

Let's build something more interesting with our input geometry. We will subdivide it and shade it smooth:

``` python
import geonodes as gn

with gn.Tree("Shading smooth") as tree:

  geo = gn.Mesh(tree.ig)      # Let's get the input geometry (allegedly a mesh)
                              # We type case to Mesh to be able to acces Mesh specific methods below
  
  geo.subdivide()             # Node named 'Subdivide Mesh'
  geo.set_shade_smooth(True)  # Node named 'Set Shade Smooth'
  
  tree.og = geo               # or tree.output_geometry = geo
``` 

## Using domains

Operations on geometries are often operations on domains properties. You will write a clearer code by making explicit
on which domain you operate. For instance, shading a mesh is in reality setting a property of the mesh faces.

A better code will be:

``` python
geo.faces.shade_smooth = True
``` 

This time, the smooth shading is treated as a property of faces. As any property, `shade_smooth` can be set and it can also be get.

In the code below, the variable `smoothed_faces` contains the values `True` or `False` for all the mesh faces,
depending if they are smoothed or not.

``` python
smoothed_faces = geo.faces.shade_smooth
```

## User inputs

In Geometry Nodes, user parameters are implemented as [Tree](Tree.md) input sockets.
These inputs can be created with the class constructor `Input` available in all the **geonodes** classes, for instance:

``` python
import geonodes as gn

with gn.Tree("Geometry Nodes") as tree:
   object = gn.Object.Input(None, "Other geometry")
   count  = gn.Integer.Input(10, "Count", min_value=2)
   factor = gn.Float.Input(0.5, "Factor", min_value=0, max_value=1, description="Use this value to control the modifier effect")
   mat    = gn.Material.Input(None, "A material")
```

The `input` constructor get a  socket name as parameter. For values such as Integer or Float, it takes the default value as first
parameter. It can also take `min_value`, `max_value` and `description` parameters for better control.

## Tree outputs

As seen above, the resulting geometry can be output with:

``` python
tree.output_geometry = geo # og alias can be also used
```

To output other values, use the method `to_output` available in all classes:

``` python
v = mesh.verts.position   # Position of vertices
v.to_output("Location")   # Location output sockets is created. Its type is Vector 
```

## A more advanced example

Let's create an icosphere, add two materials and set randomly the materials on the faces.
Once done, will extrude the faces with one particular material.

To do that, we need to learn:
- [How to create a geometry](#creating-geometries)
- [Manipulating materials](#adding-materials)
- [How to selectively change properties on domains](#selecting-faces)

### Creating geometries

Geometries are created by calling constructors of geometry classes. These constructors correspond to the menus **Mesh Primitives**
and **Curve Primitives** of the `Add node` menu in Blender.

The names of the constructors are built as CamelCase version of their node names.

``` python
icosphere = gn.Mesh.IcoSphere()
```

This create the default icosphere. We may want some customization. Looking at the node reference [Mesh.IcoSphere](api/Mesh.md#IcoSphere),
we see that there are two parameters: **Radius** and **Subdivisions**. They are implemented as parameters of the constructors.
As explained in the [naming conventions](naming.md), **geonodes** uses snake_case version of the nodes sockets and nodes parameters names:

``` python
icosphere = gn.Mesh.IcoSphere(radius=1, subdivisions=3)
```

You may want to give more control on these parameters:

``` python
radius    = gn.Float.Input(1, "Radius", min_value=0.01, max_value=10, description="A reasonable radius for the sphere")
subs      = gn.Integer.Input(3, description="No limits: I trust you")
icosphere = gn.Mesh.IcoSphere(radius=radius, subdivisions=subs)
```

We have now an icosphere which can be created with parameters exposed to the user.

### Adding materials

Materials are properties of faces. The syntax will look like `mesh.faces.material = ...`.

A material is instantiated with its name. Let's suppose that we have two existing materials named "Red" and "Blue".
To assign the materials to our icosphere, we write:

``` python
icosphere.faces.material = "Red"
icosphere.faces.material = "Blue"
```

> If the materials don't exist, the script will crash. Better ask the user to provide his own materials:

```python
mat_base = gn.Material.Input(None, "Base").    # Supposed to be Blue
mat_sel  = gn.Material.Input(None, "Selected") # Supposed to be Red

icosphere.faces.material = mat_base
icosphere.faces.material = mat_sel
```

### Selecting faces

The resulting icosphere is red because the second material was assigned to all faces, overwriting the previous assignment.
But what we want is to have a random selection of faces with a different color.
The faces can be selected by "calling" them with a selection parameter.

``` python
icosphere.faces[ random_selection ].material = mat_sel
```

A random selection can be generated using the `Random` constructor of class [Boolean](api/Boolean.md#Random):

``` python
icosphere.faces[ gn.Boolean.Random(probability=0.5) ].material = mat_sel
```

This time, the red material will overwrite only 50% of the blue faces.

Another way to reach this result is to use the material index:

``` python
icosphere.faces.material = mat_base # --> Material index 1
icosphere.faces.material = mat_sel  # --> Material index 2
   
# Two materials have be added
# All faces have their material index set to 2
# Let's change half of them back to 1

icosphere.faces[ gn.Boolean.Random(probability=.5) ].material_index = 1
```

### Extrusion

The `Extrude Mesh` node accepts a domain parameter to define what must be extruded. With **geonodes**, the 3 possibilities
are written:

``` python
mesh.faces.extrude()
mesh.edges.extrude()
mesh.verts.extrude()
```

We want to extrude faces, but only the red faces:

``` python
faces = icosphere.faces
faces[faces.material_index.equal(2)].extrude()
```

**Note:** `material_index.equal(2)` is used rather than `material_index == 2`. This late expression would give a python `bool`
result rather than the expected **geonodes** `Boolean`. See [Boolean](api/Boolean.md)

Alternatively, if you are not confident with the material indices, you can use the `material_selection` method:

``` python
faces[faces.material_selection(mat_sel)].extrude()
```

The extrusion itself can be controlled with the extrusion parameters:

``` python
faces[faces.material_index.equal(1)].extrude(offset_scale=0.3)
```

### The full code


``` python
import geonodes as gn

with gn.Tree("Icosphere tuto") as tree:

   # Good practice: let's start with the tree inputs

   radius = gn.Float.Input(1, "Radius", min_value=0.01, max_value=10, description="A reasonable radius for the sphere")
   subs   = gn.Integer.Input(3, description="No limits: I trust you")
   
   mat_base = gn.Material.Input(None, "Base")
   mat_sel  = gn.Material.Input(None, "Selected")
   
   
   # The icosphere
   
   icosphere = gn.Mesh.IcoSphere(radius=radius, subdivisions=subs)
   
   # The materials
   
   faces = icosphere.faces
   
   faces.material = mat_base
   faces[ gn.Boolean.Random(probability=.5) ].material = mat_sel
   
   # Extrude the select faces
   
   faces[faces.material_index.equal(2)].extrude(offset_scale=0.3)
   
   tree.og = icosphere
```
